# Overview

The Explorer frontend user interface is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [@stacks/ui](https://github.com/hirosystems/ui).

Before you can run Explorer on your machine locally, you must first clone the [Explorer](https://github.com/hirosystems/explorer) repository to obtain all of the necessary files and libraries needed.

# Project Dependencies

Once you have cloned the Explorer repositories, you will need to install the following project dependencies:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/en/) that includes `npm`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

> **_NOTE:_**
>
> Although Homebrew is not required to install and operate Explorer, it is highly recommended.

Open your terminal window, and make sure you are in the `/explorer` folder. Run the `yarn` to install the dependencies:

`yarn`
