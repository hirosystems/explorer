### Overview

Within the Stacks Explorer, there's a handy developer [Sandbox](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/deploy?chain=mainnet) that lets you explore, deploy and execute Clarity contracts. The Explorer Sandbox has four main features. In order to use the Explorer Sandbox, you must first connect a Stacks-compatible wallet.

## Write & Deploy
[Write & Delpoy](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/deploy?chain=mainnet) is a simple user interface to edit and deploy contracts. It works on mainnet and testnet. In this code editor, you can copy/ paste code from another source, use sample contracts and change contract parameters. If you want to save your contracts, you can also connect to the [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/).

## Function Call
[Function call](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/contract-call?chain=mainnet) lets you call any function within a contract. You can chose from the most popular contracts on Stacks or search for your own.

## STX Transfer
[STX transfer](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/transfer?chain=mainnet) makes it easy to send STX from your connected wallet to another STX compatible address.


## Testnet Faucet
To access the [Testnet Faucet feature](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet), you must be on the Testnet Network. Read more about [STX Testnet tokens](https://docs.hiro.so/api/get-stx-testnet-tokens) daily limits here or check out this short video on [how to get STX testnet tokens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9QNUvysZBE).   

For all of these features, you can search contracts that you have interacted with previously by selecting the wallet detail side panel. Simply click the hamburger menu on the right-hand side of the Sandbox for a list of contracts associated with the connected wallet. You have the option to redeploy the contract, load in the contract editor or copy the contract to interact with different function calls.
